                    <h2>Project Idea</h2>

                    <p>After getting some inspiration from ILTMS escape room puzzle and KOR escape puzzle box, I decided to make a Solve the puzzle safe box. Will you be able to solve the puzzle before the time runs out to uncover what is inside the safe box? It sounded like a cool mini game to me to play with friends like an actual escape room but also a fun way to store some things in the safe box that someone has to figure out how to open it.</p>

                    <p>I made 2 sketches of how my safe box will look like and end up going with the second sketch for the design of the safe box.</p>

                    <p>I only had doubts about what type of microcontroller I would be using as I have quite a number of inputs and outputs. So, I consulted Mr Steven to help me figure out what microcontroller to use. He helped me draw out and visualize the inputs and outputs that would be connected to the microcontroller and from there we were able to figure out that a ATtiny412 microcontroller would work just fine.</p>

                    <p>Using Fusion360, I modelled the safe box 300x300x300 with a thickness of 18mm. It has 3 parts:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Puzzle Top Piece: This is where the neopixels and button will be attached to on the groove and the big hole is where the puzzle pieces be placed for the user to play.</li>
                        <img src="images/final_project/puzzle side of safe box.png" alt="base sketch" class="heightimgwpad-270px" >

                        <li>Door: Where you would be able to open and close the safe box which will have a lock piece behind so that the servo motor will be able to lock it into place.</li>
                        <img src="images/final_project/door of safe box.png" alt="base sketch" class="heightimgwpad-270px" >

                        <li>Box: This is where you would store maybe the reward after figuring out how to put the puzzle pieces together or you can store all kinds of things.</li>

                    </ol>

                    <h3>Electronic Box</h3>
                    <p>I started to model a electronic box to store all the microcontroller and everything inside and it will be placed in the safe to kinda cover the electronics that I'll be using. Its a 215x215x25mm box with a thickness of 3mm. I also made a hole on one of the sides of the box that will feed the wire of the servo motor through and a hole for the slide switch to on and off the electronics.</p>

                    <h3>Puzzle Pieces</h3>
                    <p>Using a Puzzle template, I modelled the puzzle pieces using Fusion360. But I decided to make the puzzle pieces abit more interesting by making them like small puzzle pieces too that will be later printed out in different filament colors. It was also a nice way to hide 2 magnets on two different puzzle pieces which will make the player or user confused which pieces have the magnet and which does not.</p>

                    <p>I made a hold piece to hold the servo motor in case in the future I need to swap out the servo motor for whatever reason and I can do it easily by taking it out of the hold piece.</p>

                    <p>Using the measurements of the servo motor wing, I made a lock piece that when it turns, it will lock onto the lock piece which will lock the door.</p>

                    <p>It was easy to solder the button and I used 4 wires to make the connection longer so that it will be easier for me to plug into my PCB board. one side is input (orange wire) and the other is GND (yellow wire).</p>

I made the wires long enough that it will be able to go around the groove and have enough length to use it to connect to the pcb board.

                    <p>I used my Ender 3 V2 3D printer at home to print all my 3D printed pieces.</p>

                    <h3>Puzzle Pieces</h3>

                    <p>The first print I just tested on one of the puzzle pieces with the magnet hole and it looked great but the magnet could not fit and I was a afraid the height of where the magnet is might not be able to be detected by the reed switch so I went back to Fusion360 and modified the height as well as the magnet hole size.</p>
                    <img src="images/final_project/puzzlepiece_fail.jpg" alt="base sketch" class="heightimg-270px" >

                    <p>Then I printed the second time together with another piece, I decided to do something special in a way because my printer had a feature where I could change the filament where the printer would stop and ask to load a different color filament midway through printing so there is 2 different filament colours on the puzzle pieces to look like a sandwich abit but this second try was better and the magnet was able to fit into the magnet hole. I then proceed to print out the rest of the puzzle pieces which all turned out great. Until I ran out of green filament when printing the last 2 puzzle pieces so I used a black filament to replace the green filament. This is all the finished puzzle pieces.</p>

                    <p>The first print for the Track piece for the button, top of the track piece was too thick to let any wires through and I needed to round the corners as I had rounded corners on the grooves.

                    <p>Next was to print the transparent track piece that was for the neopixel lights as I wanted to diffuse the lights. The first print for the transparent tracks was a fail as it was a tight fit into the groove so I had to adjust the size of the walls.</p>

                    <h2>Assembly of Product</h2>
                    <h3>Laser Cut Electronic Box</h3>
                    <p>I put together the sides of the electronics box since the lid needs to be removeable. I prepared the surfaces of the acrylic side pieces by sanding it using sandpaper. Then, I glued the sides using acrylic glue and at first I tried using a cotton bud to apply the glue onto the acrylic sides but that didnt work well so I then used a paint brush to apply the glue which worked better.</p>

                    <p>But later on it started to come off and broke apart so instead I used super glue to glue the pieces back together.</p>

                    <h3>Safe Box</h3>
                    <p>I decided to put together the base and 3 sides first without the door and top side. I used a hammer and cloth the cloth is to make sure that my plywood wont have dents as plywood is soft when i try to hammer it to slide the pieces together and to try to minimize the noise when hammering. While putting together the pieces I had to make sure I was putting them the right way and making sure that it fits which most of the pieces needed more sanding to be able to fit. I used a high grit sandpaper with a file to be able to sand some of the sides so it can fit then I slowly hammer the sides to fit into place making sure that I dont spilt the wood while doing so. The pieces fit together nicely without any glue as it was a friction fit.</p>
                    <div class="finalproj-images">

                    <p>Then it was time to put the hinges for the door. I positioned where i wanted to put the hinges then proceeded to drill a small hole where the screw will be able to go in. I first screwed the hinge to the side of one of the side pieces but realized that i should screw it onto the door first before screwing on the side piece so I took it out again and put the hinge on the door first before screwing to the side piece. It managed to fit the door but i had to adjust the left side abit to make sure i can open and close the door.</p>

                    <p>I was able to then attach the top of the box to the whole safe box after glueing on the electronic box</p>

                    <h3>Glue the Servo Motor Hold and Lock Piece to the safe box</h3>
                    <p>I measured the spacing of where the servo motor would go for the hold and lock pieces and glued them with hot glue.</p>

                    <p>I wired up the neopixels to put into the groove slot in the top side of the safe box. Then I put the tracks that I made to cover up the wires. I needed to put a small acrylic at the bottom of the button to make it pop up abit from the groove which I glued using hot glue. I also wired up the push buttons and added the tracks.</p>

                    <h3>What I have learnt?</h3>
                    <p>I have learnt more about what I learnt in class like the PCB milling and CNC as it expanding my knowledge on what I can do in the future or in other personal projects like making my own PCB. I have also learnt about programming the ATtiny412 as it was not easy trying to program it as it works slightly different compared to the Arduino Uno. But throughout this whole elective journey and in the process of doing my Final project I have enjoyed the whole process from start to finish and I look forward to what other projects I can make with the skills that I have learnt and to document it so i'll be able to look back at it one day to see the projects I have worked on and being proud of it.</p>

                    <h3>What I would have done differently or improve?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Where the door was placed could be better as I only realized it later on that it was on the wrong side.</li>
                        <li>I think I could design the safe box better so that I wont have a hard time trying to put the box together</li>
                        <li>If I had more time, I would have more time to figure out the servo motor issue with the code.</li>
