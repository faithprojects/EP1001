                    <h2>Project Idea</h2>

                    <p>After getting some inspiration from ILTMS escape room puzzle and KOR escape puzzle box, I decided to make a Solve the puzzle safe box. If you will be able to solve the puzzle before the time runs out to uncover what is inside the safe box? It sounded like a cool mini game to me to play with friends like an actual escape room but also a fun way to store some things in the safe box that someone has to figure out how to open it.</p>

                    <p>I made 2 sketches of how my safe box will look like and end up going with the second sketch for the design of the safe box.</p>

                    <p>I only had doubts about what type of microcontroller I would be using as I have quite a number of inputs and outputs. So, I consulted Mr Steven to help me figure out what microcontroller to use. He helped me draw out and visualize the inputs and outputs that would be connected to the microcontroller and from there we were able to figure out that a ATTiny412 microcontroller would work just fine.</p>

                    <h3>Safe Box</h3>
                    <p>Using Fusion360, I modelled the safe box 300x300x300 with a thickness of 18mm. It has 3 parts:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Puzzle Top Piece: This is where the neopixels and button will be attached to on the groove and the big hole is where the puzzle pieces be placed for the user to play.</li>
                        <img src="images/final_project/puzzle side of safe box.png" alt="base sketch" class="heightimg-270px" >

                        <li>Door: Where you would be able to open and close the safe box which will have a lock piece behind so that the servo motor will be able to lock it into place.</li>
                        <img src="images/final_project/door of safe box.png" alt="base sketch" class="heightimg-270px" >

                        <li>Box: This is where you would store maybe the reward after figuring out how to put the puzzle pieces together or you can store all kinds of things.</li>
                        <img src="images/final_project/box.png" alt="base sketch" class="heightimg-270px" >

                    </ol>

                    <h3>Electronic Box</h3>
                    <p>I started to model a electronic box to store all the microcontroller and everything inside and it will be placed in the safe to kinda cover the electronics that I'll be using. Its a 215x215x25mm box with a thickness of 3mm. I also made a hole on one of the sides of the box that will feed the wire of the servo motor through and a hole for the slide switch to on and off the electronics.</p>

                    <h3>Puzzle Pieces</h3>
                    <p>Using a Puzzle template, I modelled the puzzle pieces using Fusion360. But I decided to make the puzzle pieces abit more interesting by making them like small puzzle pieces too that will be later printed out in different filament colors. It was also a nice way to hide 2 magnets on two different puzzle pieces which will make the player or user confused which pieces have the magnet and which does not.</p>

                    <p>I made a hold piece to hold the servo motor in case in the future I need to swap out the servo motor for whatever reason and I can do it easily by taking it out of the hold piece.</p>

                    <p>Using the measurements of the servo motor wing, I made a lock piece that when it turns, it will lock onto the lock piece which will lock the door.</p>

                    <p>So when doing the CNC, I had to change the thickness of my plywood from 18mm to 24mm as that is what the school had. Here are some pictures on the day when I did the CNC:</p>

                    <p>After cutting the CNC safe box I realized that it could not fit the finger joints together properly and that the thickness of the wood was actually 25mm than 24mm but that was ok as it will just be slightly out by alitlle. So using the sander I tried to sand the sides so that the finger joints will be able to fit well when putting them together later on.</p>

                    <h2>3D Printing</h2>
                    <p>I used my Ender 3 V2 3D printer at home to print all my 3D printed pieces.</p>

                    <h3>Puzzle Pieces</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Filament Color: White, Black and green</li>
                        <li>Infill: 10%</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The first print I just tested on one of the puzzle pieces with the magnet hole and it looked great but the magnet could not fit and I was a afraid the height of where the magnet is might not be able to be detected by the reed switch so I went back to Fusion360 and modified the height as well as the magnet hole size.</p>
                    <img src="images/final_project/puzzlepiece_fail.jpg" alt="base sketch" class="heightimg-270px" >

                    <p>Then I printed the second time together with another piece, I decided to do something special in a way because my printer had a feature where I could change the filament where the printer would stop and ask to load a different color filament midway through printing so there is 2 different filament colours on the puzzle pieces to look like a sandwich abit but this second try was better and the magnet was able to fit into the magnet hole. I then proceed to print out the rest of the puzzle pieces which all turned out great. Until I ran out of green filament when printing the last 2 puzzle pieces so I used a black filament to replace the green filament. This is all the finished puzzle pieces.</p>

                    <p>The first print for the servo motor hold piece fit perfectly but the lock piece was too small of a gap which I needed to make the gap bigger so I went back to Fusion 360 to make the changes</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>The first print for the Track piece for the button, top of the track piece was too thick to let any wires through and I needed to round the corners as I had rounded corners on the grooves. So, I went back to Fusion360 to make the changes and probably make the wall thinner too.</p>

                    <p>But on the second print the track pieces turned out better and it was a nice fit into the groove. I then went ahead and print the other track meant to cover the wires of the neopixels.</p>
                    <img src="images/final_project/track_buttonpass.jpg" alt="base sketch" class="heightimg-270px" >


                    <p>Next was to print the transparent track piece that was for the neopixel lights as I wanted to diffuse the lights. The first print for the transparent tracks was a fail as it was a tight fit into the groove so I had to adjust the size of the walls.</p>
